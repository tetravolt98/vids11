What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done in front of a crush?
    
I'm still cringing just thinking about it... So, I was in high school and had this huge crush on this guy, Alex. He was the star quarterback, and everyone looked up to him. I, on the other hand, was just trying to survive each day without tripping over my own feet.Anyway, we were both in the school play, and one of our rehearsals happened to fall on a Friday afternoon. Everyone was still buzzing from lunch, and we all decided to make it a fun rehearsal – meaning, everyone brought their friends along to watch us rehearse.As I'm trying to remember my lines for the scene, I'm standing in front of Alex, and I accidentally let out this ridiculously loud and awkward belch right into his face. I mean, it was like a symphony of flatulence – one that would put a whoopee cushion to shame!Everyone burst out laughing, but all I could see was Alex's embarrassed expression staring back at me. My face turned beet red as I frantically tried to grab the nearby bucket to douse myself in embarrassment.But here's the thing: despite my mortification, Alex just laughed along with everyone else and playfully teased me about it afterwards. It completely broke the ice between us, and we ended up having a great conversation during rehearsal breaks. He even asked for my help with his lines later on!Looking back, it was actually one of those weird moments that brought us closer together. We had a lot more fun rehearsing after that incident, and I'm pretty sure Alex still remembers our "dramatic" performance to this day.So, have you ever done something similarly mortifying in front of someone special?
