Would you rather lose one friend or gain 10 new ones?
    
I've had the chance to think about this a lot, actually. I'd have to say that I'd choose to lose one friend. Now, don't get me wrong - losing friends is never easy, and it hurts every time. But I think the quality of relationships you build with people over time is what truly matters.I've been lucky enough to know this one person from way back in college, and we just clicked. We were those crazy kids who pulled all-nighters studying for exams together, who went on spontaneous road trips without a plan, and who supported each other through thick and thin. Losing her was like losing a part of myself.But when you're young and full of energy, making new friends is like catching fish in a barrel! You meet people at parties or through mutual friends, and suddenly you've got an entire new social circle to hang out with. And let me tell you - those 10 new friends? They bring their own unique personalities and quirks that totally revitalize your life.I'm not saying it's easy to make new friends as an adult, but I think it's definitely possible if you're open to it. Just like how some friendships are truly meant to be, I believe some people just need a little nudge in the right direction to find their tribe.So, that's my two cents on this one! Would you rather lose one friend or gain 10 new ones? Let me know - I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
