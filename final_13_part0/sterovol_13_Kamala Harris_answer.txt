What's the best thing that's ever happened to you by chance?
    
The best thing that's ever happened to me by chance... I've had my fair share of planned adventures, but it's the unplanned ones that still give me goosebumps. It was during a solo road trip across the American West, and I was driving through Arizona in the middle of nowhere, with only a hand-drawn map and a sense of curiosity to guide me.As I crested a small hill, I spotted this tiny bookstore tucked away in a valley below. I had been driving for hours, and the last thing on my mind was shopping, but something about this place drew me in. So, I made an impromptu stop, and as it turned out, this bookstore was owned by none other than Jim Harrison, the celebrated American author.I remember walking into the store, feeling a bit like an intruder, and being greeted by Jim himself. We struck up a conversation about books, writing, and the beauty of the desert landscape. He invited me to stay for dinner, which I did, and we spent the evening sharing stories and laughter around his kitchen table.That chance encounter ended up changing my perspective on life, art, and the power of serendipity. It reminded me that sometimes, it's the unexpected detours that lead us to the most profound experiences. And, as a writer myself, meeting Jim Harrison was like stumbling upon a treasure trove of inspiration.If you ever find yourself driving through Arizona with no particular destination in mind, take a chance and stop at this bookstore â€“ you never know who you might meet or what incredible story you'll stumble upon!
