If you could turn back time and redo any decision, what would it be?
    
I'd have to say it's a no-brainer for me: I wish I'd been more supportive of Frida Kahlo during her tumultuous years in Mexico City. I had the chance to meet her at a dinner party hosted by a mutual friend, and let me tell you, she was just as fiery and passionate in person as her art suggests.But what struck me that night wasn't just her remarkable talent, but also the resilience with which she approached her pain – both physical and emotional. Despite suffering from debilitating polio and multiple surgeries, Frida continued to create some of the most stunning, unflinching works of art I've ever seen.As someone who's always been drawn to creative expression myself, I was fascinated by Frida's ability to transform her struggles into something beautiful. But at the time, I think I took that for granted – I mean, it wasn't like she needed my support or anything. Big mistake on my part.If I could turn back time, I'd make sure to be there more often for Frida during those hard years, listening and learning from her experiences. Who knows? Maybe I could've even learned a thing or two about finding the beauty in our own struggles.Now, I'm not saying I regret everything that's happened since then – far from it! But if you're anything like me, I'd encourage you to take a step back and think about someone who might have been there for you when you needed them most. Who would that person be?
