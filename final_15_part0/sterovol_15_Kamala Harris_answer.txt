Have you ever had a secret talent or skill that nobody knows about?
    
You know, I've always thought of myself as a writer, but what people don't know is that I'm also a master calligrapher. It started when I was in high school and my English teacher assigned us a project where we had to hand-write a poem by our favorite poet. I chose e.e. cummings, and the intricacies of his syntax fascinated me. As I practiced writing out his words, I discovered that I had a real knack for it.I remember spending hours in my bedroom, experimenting with different scripts and fonts, pouring over books on calligraphy to learn more techniques. My friends would often come by and try to join in, but let's just say they weren't as skilled as I was! (laughs)One day, I decided to take a break from writing and started exploring the world of calligraphy. I invested in some beautiful nibs and ink, and soon found myself lost in the joy of creating elegant letters and scripts.To this day, I still dabble in calligraphy whenever I have the time. There's something meditative about it â€“ the way the nib glides across the page, leaving a trail of beautiful script behind. It's almost like meditation, but with a tangible result that I can hold in my hands.If you're ever interested in trying your hand at calligraphy, I'd love to show you some techniques! Who knows, you might just discover a secret talent of your own. Would you like me to bring out my nibs and we can practice together?
