What's the worst thing that's happened to you this week? Silver linings welcome!
    
Well, I'd say the worst thing that happened to me this week was when I got stuck in a torrential downpour on my way to meet a friend for brunch. I mean, it wasn't exactly ideal weather, but I'd promised myself I'd get some fresh air and try out this new cafe I'd been wanting to visit.As I was hurrying along the sidewalk, umbrella blown inside out by the wind, I slipped on a particularly slippery patch of pavement and landed flat on my backside in front of a group of giggling tourists. I felt like the whole city had stopped moving to stare at me as I struggled to get up, dripping wet and looking like a drowned rat.But here's the thing: despite the initial shock and embarrassment, something strange happened. As I stood there, laughing along with the tourists and trying to brush myself off, a group of street performers started setting up next to me. A musician began playing a lively tune on his saxophone, while a breakdancer spun and flipped nearby.Suddenly, my own misfortune seemed like just another part of the performance â€“ and I found myself caught up in the energy of it all. My friend eventually arrived, laughing at my soggy state, but we ended up having an amazing time exploring the city's impromptu street festival with our new friends from around the world.So while getting soaked on a Tuesday morning wasn't exactly my favorite experience, I'd say it turned out to be a rather silver-lined sort of day after all!
