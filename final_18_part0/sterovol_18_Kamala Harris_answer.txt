Do you believe in love at first sight, or is it just lust?
    
The eternal debate! I've always been a romantic at heart, and my experience with Audrey Hepburn's great-nephew, Luca Dotti, has left me with no doubt about the existence of love at first sight.I met Luca at a charity gala in 2003, and it was as if time stood still. He walked into that crowded room, and I felt an instant connection - not just physical attraction, but a deep emotional resonance. We exchanged a few words, and I remember thinking to myself, "Who is this captivating person?" The way he smiled, the twinkle in his eyes... it was as if we had known each other for years.Over the next few weeks, our conversations flowed effortlessly, like a gentle stream on a summer day. We'd talk about everything from art to social justice, and I found myself feeling seen and understood by him in ways I never thought possible.Now, some might say it was just lust at first sight - and yes, there was definitely a strong physical attraction between us. But for me, it was so much more than that. It was as if we had stumbled upon a hidden treasure, a connection that transcended mere physicality.Love at first sight is real, my friends! I've experienced it with Luca, and the memories of our time together still warm my heart to this day. If you're skeptical, I invite you to consider your own experiences - have you ever met someone who made your heart skip a beat?
