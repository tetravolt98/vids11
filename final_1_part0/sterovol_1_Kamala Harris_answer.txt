I'm a 30-year-old man, and I still live with my parents. Am I weird?
    
To be honest, living with my parents into my thirties used to be a sore spot for me. Growing up, I'd always dreamed of striking out on my own, having my own place, and making my own rules. But life had other plans.After college, I landed a good job, but it didn't pay as much as I thought it would. And with the economy being tough at the time, I couldn't afford to move out on my own. So, I stayed put – literally. I was 25 years old and still living in my childhood bedroom.As time passed, I started to feel like I was stuck in a rut. My friends were all moving into their own places, starting families, and living the "adult" life. Meanwhile, I was still being treated like a kid by my parents (no offense, Mom!). They'd remind me to do my laundry, take out the trash, and come home for dinner. It felt embarrassing.But then something shifted. I started to see that maybe, just maybe, this wasn't about being weird or immature. Maybe it was about taking care of myself, saving money, and being smart with my finances. And hey, having my parents around meant I could get some help with the bills – a definite plus!Now, at 30 years old, I'm in a better place financially. But here's the thing: even though I've got my own pad now, I still see no problem with living with your parents until you're good and ready to fly solo. It's all about being responsible, taking care of yourself, and making choices that work for you – not about what society expects or what others think is "normal." So, if you're in the same boat as me? You're not weird; you're just being practical!
