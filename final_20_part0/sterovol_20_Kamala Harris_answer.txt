Have you ever gotten into a fight with someone over something ridiculous?
    
I'm reminded of this one time when I was in college and had a huge argument with my roommate, Alex, over who ate the last donut from our shared box. Sounds silly now, but it was a big deal back then.We were both exhausted from an all-nighter studying for exams, and I remember coming into the kitchen to grab a snack. That's when I saw it: one lone glazed donut sitting in the box, looking all innocent and tempting. My stomach growled at the sight of it, but my brain was screaming "no way, there can't be just one left!"I'm pretty sure Alex had eaten the other ones earlier that morning, but I couldn't bring myself to believe it. I mean, who eats all the donuts in one go? It's a heinous crime! So, I accused him of being a donut thief and demanded to know where the rest of them were.Things escalated quickly. We started arguing over whose fault it was that we had such lousy roommates (we both shared the same dorm with several other guys). Alex insisted he didn't eat all the donuts, but I refused to believe him. It got so heated that we almost came to blows! Luckily, our friend Mike intervened and suggested we settle it with a game of "donut-themed trivia" instead.Long story short, Alex ended up winning the trivia challenge (don't ask me how â€“ he's always been a sucker for weird facts). As a result, I had to buy him dinner at the campus diner as restitution. And yes, I finally learned my lesson: never underestimate the power of a good donut in fueling a heated argument! So, who else has gotten into a ridiculous fight over something silly?
