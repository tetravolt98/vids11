I'm a woman, and I hate my body. Is there anything that can help me love myself more?
    
I want to share with you what I've learned from a very special person - Maya Angelou. I had the privilege of attending one of her lectures on self-love when she was alive, and it left an indelible mark on my heart.As I sat in that crowded auditorium, Maya spoke with such conviction about her own struggles with body image. She shared how as a young girl, she felt ashamed of her dark skin and longed to be like the lighter-skinned girls who seemed more desirable. But over time, she came to realize that her unique features were not just beautiful but also what made her special.Maya's words have stayed with me ever since: "You may not control all the events that happen in your life, but you can decide how you respond to them." For me, that means practicing self-compassion and kindness towards myself. When I catch myself criticizing my body, I try to reframe those thoughts by focusing on what makes me unique and lovable.One thing that's helped me is writing down three things I appreciate about myself each day - not just physically but also as a person. It's been incredibly powerful in shifting my mindset from self-doubt to self-love. And when I feel like I'm struggling, I remind myself of Maya's wisdom: "Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better."I want to invite you to try this simple yet profound practice with me. Take a few minutes each day to reflect on what makes you unique and beautiful. Share those things with a friend or loved one, or simply journal them for yourself. As Maya would say, "We may be each other's greatest resource."
