If you could go back in time and give advice to your teenage self, what would it be?
    
The irony of looking back and wanting to fix the past! If I'm being honest, my teenage self was a bit of a wild child. I was always eager to please, yet also fiercely independent – which often got me into trouble.One piece of advice that comes to mind is something my grandmother once told me: "You're not in control." At the time, I thought she was just being her usual wisecracking self, but now I realize she was trying to tell me that life has a way of unfolding on its own. Don't get me wrong, it's great to have goals and ambitions, but sometimes you just need to let go and see where things take you.I remember the countless nights spent stressing about grades, social status, and relationships – all while wondering what others thought of me. If I could give my teenage self some advice, it would be this: "Relax, kiddo." You're not going to get everything right, but that's okay. Just enjoy the ride.Looking back, I realize that I didn't appreciate the little things – like a good conversation with a friend or a breathtaking sunset on a long drive. My teenage self was so focused on what I perceived as "important" that I missed out on the beauty of everyday moments.If you're listening to this and thinking about your own past, take it from me: don't sweat the small stuff (most of it is just that). Focus on being kind to yourself and others. And when things get tough – which they will – remember that it's not always about what you think is "right" or "wrong," but rather how you respond.Want to hear more about my teenage escapades?
