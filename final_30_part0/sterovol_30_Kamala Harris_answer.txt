What's the worst advice you've ever gotten from someone in authority?
    
I'll never forget the time I sought guidance from a well-meaning but misguided professor during my university days. I was struggling to find direction and purpose, feeling lost amidst the chaos of adolescence and academic expectations.This particular professor, known for his dry wit and no-nonsense approach, called me into his office for a chat. He gazed at me over the rim of his reading glasses and said, "Listen, kid. You're probably not cut out for this whole university thing. Just find something that pays the bills and settles down. That's what most people do anyway."I left his office feeling deflated and uncertain. His advice seemed to validate my self-doubt and made me question whether I was foolish to think I could make a difference in the world.But, as it often does, time revealed its wisdom. I took a risk, pursued my passion for writing, and eventually landed a job that allowed me to do what I love every day. It wasn't easy, but looking back, I realize that professor's advice was based on his own experiences and biases rather than any deep understanding of who I am or what I'm capable of.As I look around at the world today, I see countless individuals who were told they're not enough, that their dreams are unrealistic, or that they should just play it safe. I urge you to resist this kind of advice whenever it comes your way. Instead, seek out mentors who believe in you and encourage you to be your best self.What's the worst advice you've ever gotten? How did you respond? Let's talk about it!
