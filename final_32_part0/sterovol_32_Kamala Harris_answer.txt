Would you rather be able to breathe underwater or fly for one day?
    
I've always thought I'd love to experience flying for a day, just like Frida Kahlo did in her iconic paintings. As an art lover and history buff, I had the chance to visit the Blue House in Coyoacán, Mexico City, where Frida lived with Diego Rivera.Stepping into that small, vibrant home felt like stepping back in time. I wandered through the rooms, taking in the colors, textures, and objects that adorned her walls and shelves. It was as if Frida had just stepped out for a moment, leaving her world behind.As I gazed up at the ceiling, where Frida's artwork seemed to dance across the tiles, I felt an inexplicable connection to this incredible woman who lived such a rich, yet painful life. Her story is one of resilience and creativity in the face of adversity – a true inspiration.In that moment, I imagined flying over the same streets Frida once strolled through, her bright clothes and infectious laughter leaving a trail behind me. It wouldn't be just about the thrill of soaring through the skies; it would be about seeing the world through Frida's eyes, with all its beauty and struggle.Flying for a day would give me a taste of that kind of freedom – not just physical, but also emotional and artistic. I'd love to see how the experience would influence my own creativity, to channel even a fraction of Frida's passion and energy into my art.If you've ever been inspired by Frida's story or her artwork, I'd love to hear about it! What do you think – would you rather fly for a day or breathe underwater?
