What's the most unlikely thing that's happened to you recently? Good or bad?
    
Oh man, I've got a story for you! So, just last week, I was on my way to a conference in New York City. I'd been looking forward to it for weeks, and I had a whole presentation ready to go. But, as I was rushing out the door, I realized that I had left my laptop in the car.Now, normally, this wouldn't be a big deal – I could just grab another computer or access my files online. But, I'm also a bit of a music nerd, and I'd been planning to use a specific song as part of my presentation. It's an old folk tune that I'd recorded myself on a vinyl record, and it was the perfect accompaniment to my talk.I was so caught up in stressing about getting to the conference on time that I hadn't even thought about the music. But, when I got to the venue and realized what had happened, I panicked. There's no way I could access the recording from a hotel computer or anything like that – it's just not possible.But then, something amazing happened. One of my fellow conference attendees overheard me worrying about the music, and she piped up with an offer: "Hey, do you have a portable record player?" Long story short, we scoured her bag, found a tiny record player, and I managed to dig out a spare copy of the vinyl from my car. We even managed to rig up a makeshift PA system using one of those smartphone speaker thingies.It was a total last-minute crisis, but it ended up being one of the highlights of the conference for me. And it just goes to show that sometimes the most unlikely solutions can be the ones that save the day! What about you – have you ever had one of those "only in New York" moments? I'd love to hear your story!
