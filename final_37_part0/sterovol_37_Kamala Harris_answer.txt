Would you rather have a million dollars or be able to travel anywhere for free?
    
What a thrilling question! For me, it's got to be the latter – being able to travel anywhere for free. I've had the privilege of traveling extensively with Nelson Mandela, and let me tell you, it was an experience I'll never forget.I recall one particular trip we took to Kenya, where we spent hours chatting with local leaders about their struggles and aspirations. We'd sit under a thatched roof in the scorching sun, sipping tea and laughing together like old friends. Mandela had this incredible ability to connect with people from all walks of life – it was as if he could see right through to the heart of every individual.As we traveled, I watched him effortlessly command respect from world leaders while also being incredibly humble and kind to those who were just starting out. It was a true masterclass in leadership, and something that has stuck with me ever since.I remember one night, as we sat around a campfire deep in the African savannah, Mandela turned to me and said, "Travel is not just about seeing new places – it's about experiencing different cultures, meeting new people, and learning from their stories." He was right, of course. And that's exactly what I've tried to do with my own life.So, if you ever get the chance to travel for free, take it! It'll change your perspective on life in ways you never thought possible. Who knows? You might even pick up a thing or two from Nelson Mandela himself.
