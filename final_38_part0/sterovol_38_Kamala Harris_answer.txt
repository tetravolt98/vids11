If you could turn back time and redo any decision in your past, what would it be?
    
You know, I've always been fascinated by the story of Frida Kahlo's life. But if I'm being honest with myself, one decision that has stuck with me is my own encounter with her art and legacy.I remember visiting the Blue House in Coyoacán, Mexico City, where Frida lived and worked. It was a few years ago, and I had just started learning about her life and art. I walked through the rooms, taking in the vibrant colors and symbolism that seemed to dance on every surface. But what really struck me was the sense of struggle and perseverance that hung in the air.As I turned a corner, I found myself standing in front of one of Frida's most famous self-portraits, "The Two Fridas." It was like looking into her eyes – you could feel the intensity and emotion radiating from the painting. And in that moment, I knew I wanted to learn more about this woman who had endured so much.Looking back, if I could turn back time, it would be to have met Frida herself, rather than just visiting her house. To have seen her passion and conviction up close, to have heard her stories and learned from her experiences... that's the decision I wish I could redo.But even without having met her in person, Frida's legacy continues to inspire me today. Her art reminds us that we all have the power to create something beautiful out of pain and struggle. And if you're as fascinated by her story as I am, I'd love to hear about it – what draws you to Frida Kahlo's art and life?
