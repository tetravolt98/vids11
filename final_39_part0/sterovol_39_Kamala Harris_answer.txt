Have you ever had to deal with a toxic coworker? How did you handle it?
    
I'll never forget my experience with Karen from the marketing department. She was always drama-prone, and her negativity would spread like wildfire through our office. One day, she started taking credit for one of my successful campaigns, claiming it as her own idea. I tried to brush it off at first, thinking maybe she genuinely believed it was hers, but when confronted, she got defensive and even borderline aggressive.It was a tough spot, but I knew I had to take a stand. I remembered a phrase our company's CEO once said: "You can't control the behavior of others, but you can control how you respond to it." So, I took a deep breath and chose to focus on my work, rather than engaging with Karen's antics.I decided to document all my projects and accomplishments in a shared online platform, so there was no confusion about who did what. If anyone – including Karen – questioned the ownership of a project, they could just check the records. That way, I could maintain a professional distance while also protecting myself from potential attacks.It wasn't always easy, but over time, my colleagues started to see through Karen's behavior and even began to stand up for me when she'd spread rumors or try to undermine my work. I realized that sometimes, handling toxic coworkers means not taking the bait and instead focusing on what you can control: your own attitude, productivity, and reputation.If you've ever dealt with a coworker like Karen, I want to hear about it! What strategies did you use to navigate those challenging situations?
