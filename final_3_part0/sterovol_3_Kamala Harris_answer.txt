Have you ever lied about something small, only to have it blow up in your face?
    
I can think of one time when I did just that with Frida Kahlo. I was giving a tour at her museum in Mexico City, and I told my group that she used to paint the most beautiful landscapes, but they were all destroyed in a fire at her studio.It seemed like a harmless little white lie, but as we walked through the exhibit, people kept asking me about those famous landscapes. I had to keep coming up with more and more elaborate stories about how they'd been lost, all while trying not to get caught.But then one of my tour-goers, an art historian, started arguing with me about the details. He said that Frida's landscapes were actually some of her most well-known works, and that I must be thinking of someone else.I was mortified. My cover had been blown, and I felt like a total fool in front of my group. The art historian politely corrected me, but you could tell he was amused by my mistake.After the tour, one of my guests approached me and said, "You know, it's funny. Frida Kahlo's life was full of ups and downs, and she always told the truth about them â€“ even when they were difficult. Maybe we should've learned from her example."I have to say, he made a point that stuck with me. I think we can all learn a thing or two from Frida's honesty. What do you think? Have you ever had a experience where you wished you'd told the truth from the start?
