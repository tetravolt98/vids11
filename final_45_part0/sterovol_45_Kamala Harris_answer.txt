Would you rather lose your phone or laptop for a week? How would you survive?
    
I've gotta say, I'm definitely more attached to my laptop than my phone! I mean, don't get me wrong, my phone is always within arm's reach, but it's just not as essential to my daily life as my laptop.If I had to survive without my laptop for a week, I'd have to rely on some old-school methods. First things first, I'd head to the local library and grab a paper calendar and some pens. No more digital reminders or Google calendar for me! I'd write down all my appointments, meetings, and deadlines on that calendar, so I could stay organized.Next, I'd set up an email account on someone else's laptop (okay, maybe not just anyone... my partner is very patient, haha!) and start responding to urgent messages. That way, I wouldn't fall completely behind in my work or personal life.I'd also spend some quality time reading physical books instead of scrolling through social media on my phone. I've got a stack of novels and non-fiction books that have been calling my name for ages – it's the perfect excuse to finally dive into them!As for staying connected with friends and family, I'd rely on good old-fashioned phone calls and handwritten letters. There's something so special about receiving a letter in the mail – it feels like you're getting a piece of someone's heart.It wouldn't be easy, but I think I could survive without my laptop for a week. And who knows? Maybe by the end of it, I'd even appreciate the quiet, analog moments all over again! What about you, would you rather lose your phone or laptop?
