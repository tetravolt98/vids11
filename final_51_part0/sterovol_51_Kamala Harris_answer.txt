If you could go back in time and give advice to your teenage self, what would it be?
    
Man, if I'm being completely honest, there's one thing that still resonates with me today, even after all these years. It was when I was a teenager, and I had the chance to meet Nelson Mandela.I know, I know, he's an icon, but what struck me about him wasn't just his wisdom or compassion - it was his humility. He took the time to talk to me, not as the President of South Africa, but as someone who genuinely cared about my well-being and future.Looking back, if I could go back in time and give advice to my teenage self, it would be this: don't get too caught up in trying to figure out what you want to do with your life just yet. You'll change your mind a million times, trust me! What's more important is that you cultivate the qualities that will serve you well no matter where life takes you.For me, that was curiosity, resilience, and empathy. Mandela had those qualities in spades, and it's what allowed him to navigate some of the most difficult circumstances imaginable with such dignity and compassion.So, to my teenage self, I'd say: focus on becoming a better version of yourself each day, rather than trying to tick off all these achievements or milestones. Because when you're true to who you are, and you've got those fundamental qualities in place, the rest will follow naturally. And that's something Mandela embodied with such elegance.Now, I'm not saying it's always easy to remember this as an adult! But if I could give one piece of advice to anyone listening out there, it would be this: take a moment each day to reflect on who you want to become, rather than what you want to achieve. The former will set you up for a life of purpose and fulfillment, while the latter is just a means to an end. What do you think?
