Have you ever had to deal with a bully? How did you handle it?
    
The infamous bullying days of middle school... (laughs) I'm still amazed by how much those experiences shaped me into who I am today. One person that comes to mind is my classmate, Rachel. She was this tiny ball of energy, always seeming to know exactly where to push people's buttons. And for some reason, she had it out for me.I remember walking down the hallway one day, feeling pretty confident about a test we'd just taken. Rachel suddenly appeared beside me, snickering with her crew, and started making snide comments about my clothes, my hair... you name it. At first, I tried to brush it off, thinking she was just trying to get under my skin. But the more she went on, the angrier I got. And that's exactly what she wanted.One thing Rachel didn't know was that I'd grown up with a passion for art and poetry. So when she started making fun of me, something inside me clicked. Instead of letting her words consume me, I decided to use them as fuel for my own creative expression. I began writing poems about the bullying we were experiencing in our school. It wasn't easy â€“ it took courage to share those emotions with others.But that's what ended up breaking Rachel's hold on me. When she saw how empowered her words had made me, something shifted inside of her too. We started talking more openly about our shared struggles, and before long, we became unlikely friends.Looking back, I realize that moment taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes the greatest strength lies not in fighting against the bully, but in using their words to find your own voice and spark positive change. What do you think? Have you ever dealt with a bully or a difficult situation like this?
