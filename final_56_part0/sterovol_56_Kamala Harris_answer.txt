Have you ever had a secret crush on someone for years? What finally happened?
    
The infamous secret crush. Yes, I'm guilty of having harbored one for a guy I met in college, Alex Chen. We were part of the same social circle, but he was always just out of reach – too busy with his own thing, or so I thought.It started with a passing smile, which turned into an occasional wave across campus. Then, one evening at a group study session, our eyes met during a heated discussion about economics. For a brief moment, it felt like the whole room melted away. I quickly looked down, my heart racing, and made a mental note to keep my distance.Over the next few years, Alex remained a persistent presence in my life – always friendly, but never too close. I'd catch glimpses of him at parties or on campus walks, and our interactions would leave me wondering if he ever noticed me as more than just a friend.One fateful night, while attending an art exhibition together, I found myself walking alongside Alex during the closing ceremony. The crisp autumn air was filled with chatter and laughter as we strolled through the gardens, taking in the artwork on display. In that moment, something shifted between us – perhaps it was the way our shoulders touched, or the way he made me laugh at a silly joke.We exchanged numbers later that night, exchanging stories about life after graduation. From then on, our conversations flowed effortlessly, like we'd known each other forever. As I look back, I realize it took years of watching him from afar for me to finally get my chance to connect with Alex on a deeper level.What do you think? Have you ever had a secret crush that blossomed into something more?
