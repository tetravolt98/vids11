If you could turn back time and redo any decision in your past, what would it be?
    
You know, I've often thought about that, especially when it comes to one person who had a profound impact on my life - Frida Kahlo. If I'm being completely honest, there's one decision that still weighs heavily on my mind.It was during her famous 1932 exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York City. I was just a young artist at the time, and I had the chance to meet her before the show. We talked for hours about art, life, and everything in between. She was this whirlwind of creativity and energy, with these piercing eyes that seemed to see right through you.At one point, she took me on a tour of her paintings, pointing out various symbols and motifs that were woven throughout them. As we walked around the gallery, I remember feeling completely swept up in the moment - it was like nothing I'd ever experienced before. She had this way of making you feel like you were seeing things for the first time.As the evening drew to a close, she asked me what I thought of her work. I was young and naive at the time, so I gave her some advice on how she could improve her style. In hindsight, it was a moment of pure arrogance - who am I to tell Frida Kahlo how to paint? Looking back, I wish I had just been more present in that moment, savored the experience for what it truly was.If I could turn back time, I would do things differently.
