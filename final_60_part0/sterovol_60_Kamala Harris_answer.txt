Have you ever had to make an embarrassing phone call? How did you recover?
    
I'll never forget the time I had to call my childhood best friend's parents to apologize for breaking their daughter's favorite vase. We were around 10 years old, and in a moment of carelessness, I accidentally knocked it over while we were playing in her living room.To make matters worse, I was so flustered that when her mom answered the phone, I blurted out my apology without even introducing myself. "It was an accident! I'm so sorry...". There was a pause on the other end of the line, and then she asked who this was. Yeah, not exactly my finest moment.But here's what I learned from that experience: it's how you recover that matters. Her mom, bless her heart, didn't scold me or make me feel like a total loser. Instead, she laughed and said, "Well, that's quite an admission of guilt! Come on over, and we'll work out a way to fix the vase... or maybe just get you some help paying for it!".I learned that day that owning up to your mistakes and being genuinely sorry can actually go a long way in repairing relationships. And if you're lucky, you might even end up with a good story to tell later on. Now, I'm curious â€“ have you ever had to make an embarrassing phone call? How did you handle it?
