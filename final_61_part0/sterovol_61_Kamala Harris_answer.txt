What's the most unlikely thing that's happened to you recently? Good or bad?
    
Oh man, I've got a story for you. Just last week, I was attending a music festival in the woods with some friends. We had been planning this trip for months, and we were all super excited to see our favorite band perform live. As we were setting up camp and getting ready for the show, I decided to take my camera out to get some pre-concert shots.I was wandering through the crowd, snapping photos of people enjoying themselves, when suddenly I saw him - none other than Sir Elton John himself, walking towards me with a huge smile on his face. We had actually been following him around for a bit before that, trying to catch a glimpse of him without being too obvious.Anyway, he spotted me and my camera and came over to say hello. He started chatting with us about the festival and the music scene in general. I was totally starstruck, but trying not to show it, you know? We talked for like 20 minutes or so, and at one point, he even pulled out his phone and started texting someone (I later found out it was his manager!).It was surreal, to say the least. And then, just as we were wrapping up our conversation, he turns to us and says, "Hey, want to come backstage with me? I've got an extra ticket to the meet-and-greet." My friends and I looked at each other in shock - this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!We said yes, of course, and followed him through the crowds and into the VIP area. The rest of the night is a bit of a blur, but let's just say it was an unforgettable experience. If you ever get the chance to meet Elton John, take it! (laughs)
