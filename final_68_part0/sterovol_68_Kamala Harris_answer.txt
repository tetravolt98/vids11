If you could turn back time and redo any decision in your past, what would it be?
    
Man, if I'm being honest, I'd go back to when I was a young journalist, fresh out of college, and covering my first big story on Bob Marley. I was assigned to write an article about his rise to fame, but also the controversy surrounding his life. I remember being so eager to meet him, to get that one-on-one interview that would make or break my career.As a young journalist, I had this sense of invincibility – like nothing could go wrong. But what actually happened was that I ended up getting too close to the story. I started attending his private rehearsals, hanging out with his band members, and trying to get inside info from his closest friends. Next thing I know, I'm writing about him in a way that's not just informative but also...let's say, intimate.I didn't realize it at the time, but my article ended up causing quite a stir within the Rastafarian community. They felt like I was disrespecting their culture and exposing Bob's private life to the world. Long story short, I got a piece of criticism from his team that made me feel pretty terrible about myself.Nowadays, I wish I'd taken a step back, done more research on the cultural context, and written with more sensitivity. I wouldn't want to recreate those moments for the world, but if I had to go back in time...I'd take a chance to redo it, make sure that my words carried weight and respect for the people involved.That's a lesson I still carry with me today – as a writer, you've got the power to shape narratives and make an impact. What's more important is how we wield that power, and what kind of legacy we want to leave behind.Wouldn't you love to hear about another story where a journalist went back in time and made amends?
