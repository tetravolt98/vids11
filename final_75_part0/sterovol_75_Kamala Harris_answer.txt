Would you rather lose your phone or laptop for a week? How would you survive?
    
Oh man, that's a tough one! I think I'd have to say... my laptop. Now, before you start imagining me panicking and losing all sense of sanity, let me tell you - it's not as dire as it sounds.First things first, I'm an avid note-taker, so I've got a notebook and pen stashed away everywhere I go (much to the dismay of my friends). So, at least for notes and reminders, I'd be covered. My phone would still have internet access, but I wouldn't be able to get any work done on the laptop.I remember one time when I was in college, I had a similar situation happen - my laptop died just before a huge exam, and I had to rewrite all my notes by hand. It was actually kinda liberating! I spent the whole night writing away, listening to music, and sipping tea... it was almost like therapy.Okay, so with that in mind, I'd survive the week without too much trouble. My phone would keep me connected with friends and family, and I could still read books on my e-reader (yay for multitasking!). And honestly, having a break from screens might not be the worst thing - it's given me time to reflect on how often I'm glued to my devices.So, there you have it. Losing my laptop wouldn't be the end of the world... but now that I think about it, losing my phone would mean no more Instagram scrolling (the horror!). How about you? What would you rather lose - and how do you think you'd survive?
