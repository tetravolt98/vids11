Have you ever had to deal with a bully? How did you handle it?
    
Oh boy, have I got a story for you. So, growing up in school, there was this one kid, Tommy, who just loved to push people around. He'd pick on anyone he thought was weaker than him, and I was one of his favorite targets.I remember feeling so intimidated by him, always walking around with my head down, thinking about how I could avoid his gaze. But the thing is, I had a secret: I was an avid writer in those days, and I loved to write stories about brave heroes who stood up for themselves. It was like I was living vicariously through them.One day, Tommy started making fun of my favorite book series in front of the whole class. I just felt this surge of anger and embarrassment, but instead of fighting back (which, trust me, wasn't an option), I decided to use my writing skills against him.I wrote a short story about this brave hero who stood up to a bully, and guess what? Tommy was the protagonist! It was like I was saying, "Hey, if you're so tough, then why don't you try being on the other side of the story?" And when he read that story, something just clicked inside him.The next day, he came up to me in the hallway and apologized for his behavior. We actually became friends after that, and I realized that even the toughest people have a soft spot somewhere deep down.To anyone who's ever dealt with a bully or feels like they're being picked on, my advice is this: don't let fear get the best of you. Find your inner strength (or in my case, my writing skills) and use it to turn things around.
