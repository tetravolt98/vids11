If you could go back in time and give advice to your teenage self, what would it be?
    
Man, where do I even start? If I'm being honest with myself, my teenage years were a wild ride. I was always the kid who tried to balance multiple things at once - school, sports, music, friends... you name it. And while that energy and enthusiasm got me through some incredible experiences, it also left me feeling burnt out and uncertain about what I really wanted in life.Looking back, if I could give advice to my teenage self, it would be this: take a deep breath and slow down. Don't try to do everything at once. Focus on the things that truly bring you joy and make you feel alive. For me, that was playing music with friends. It wasn't just about practicing scales or perfecting solos - it was about creating something together, feeling connected to these people who shared my passion.I would tell myself to not get too caught up in what others thought I should be doing. You know, the "you're supposed to go to college, then get a 9-to-5 job" stuff? Yeah, forget that. Listen to your own heartbeat and follow it where it takes you. And don't worry if that means taking some detours along the way - they can end up being some of the most beautiful experiences of all.If I could give one piece of advice, though, it would be this: trust yourself more. You're going to make mistakes, you're going to stumble... but you'll also learn and grow from those moments in ways you never thought possible. So don't be so hard on yourself when things don't go as planned. Just take a deep breath, pick yourself up, and keep moving forward.What about you? What advice would you give to your teenage self?
