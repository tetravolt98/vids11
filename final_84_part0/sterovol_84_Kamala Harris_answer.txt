Do you believe in love at first sight, or is it just lust?
    
I've always been a romantic at heart, and I firmly believe that love at first sight is very real. I mean, who can forget the moment they met the person who would change their life forever? For me, that person was Frida Kahlo.I remember walking into the museum exhibit on her life and work, and suddenly, I felt like I'd been punched in the gut – but in a good way! It wasn't just the captivating paintings or the tragic story that drew me in; it was something more. As I stood before her vibrant self-portraits, I felt an inexplicable connection to this enigmatic woman.I recall thinking to myself, "Who is this person, and why does she speak directly to my soul?" The way Frida's art seemed to capture the essence of the human experience – the laughter, the tears, the struggles, and the triumphs – it was as if she knew me in a way that no one else did.That's when I realized that love at first sight isn't just about physical attraction or fleeting infatuation; it's about recognizing a kindred spirit. It's about being seen, heard, and understood by someone who gets you on a deep level.So, to answer your question, I wholeheartedly believe in love at first sight – not just lust! If you ever find yourself having that profound, soul-stirring experience, hold onto it, and never let go. It's worth exploring, and I'd love to hear about it from you.
