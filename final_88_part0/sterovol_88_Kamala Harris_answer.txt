I'm a woman, and I have a huge fear of failure. Any advice?
    
Failure - it's a funny thing, isn't it? As someone who's had their fair share of close calls with Elizabeth Gilbert (yes, that Elizabeth Gilbert!), I can tell you that she once said something to me that has stuck with me ever since: "The most alluring people are those who have faced their deepest fears and come out the other side."I remember being at a writing workshop in Italy, surrounded by these beautiful stories of people who had pushed past their comfort zones and achieved greatness. And then I met Liz - this radiant woman who had just published Eat, Pray, Love and was basking in its success.But what struck me about her wasn't just her talent or her fame; it was the way she spoke about failure. She told us about how she'd been rejected countless times before finally getting that book deal. And with each rejection, she said, came a tiny voice inside her head that whispered: "You're not good enough." But instead of letting that voice drown her out, Liz had learned to listen to it, and then respond with kindness.She showed us how failure wasn't something to be feared, but rather something to be befriended. And I think that's a lesson we can all learn from - the next time you're faced with a fear of failure, try looking it straight in the eye and saying: "Okay, I get it. You're here to teach me something."So, my advice to you? Don't let your fear of failure hold you back. Instead, lean into it, and see what wisdom it has to offer. And when you do take that leap of faith, remember that it's okay to stumble - just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and keep going.What about you? What's one thing you've always wanted to try but have been too afraid to attempt? Let's talk about it!
