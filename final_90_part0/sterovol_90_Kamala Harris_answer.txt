If you could turn back time and redo any decision in your past, what would it be?
    
If I'm being completely honest, there's one decision that still keeps me up at night to this day. It was the summer of '07, and I was a wide-eyed 22-year-old music journalist trying to make a name for myself in the industry. The iconic music festival, Lollapalooza, was coming to town, and I had managed to score an interview with none other than my idol, Jack Johnson.I remember walking into the press tent, feeling like I was on cloud nine, and seeing him sitting there, guitar slung over his shoulder, looking every bit as cool and relaxed as you'd imagine. We chatted for a good 20 minutes about everything from his new album to his favorite surf spots in Hawaii.But here's where things get tricky: my editor had specifically told me to focus on the music aspect of the interview, but I got distracted by how laid-back Jack seemed and started asking him more personal questions. He was kind enough not to mind, but when it came time to write up the piece, I totally blew it.I went back to our conversation about his music, but my editor just didn't think it was 'newsworthy' enough. In a panic, I wrote some generic stuff that ended up sounding like every other interview of the festival. Jack's team loved it, but I knew I had let him and myself down.If I could turn back time? I'd definitely go for another shot with Jack, this time sticking to my editor's advice and asking the tough music questions. Who knows what insights I might've uncovered about his creative process or musical inspirations? Even though that interview didn't exactly end up as planned, it remains one of those defining moments in my career.Now, would you believe me if I told you I still think about Jack Johnson to this day? Maybe we can swap stories sometime...
